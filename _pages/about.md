<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Laser Spectroscopy Research Laboratory (LSRL),</strong> is a newly founded laboratory at the Department of Physics at Yazd University. This laboratory is part of the Yazd Photonics Research Group (YPRG). Theoretical and experimental research topics in practical and interdisciplinary fields of spectroscopy are the research topics of this laboratory. At the moment, major research activities in this laboratory are preceded with the cooperation of faculty members, young researchers, and postgraduate students. There are different research projects are conducted and supervised by the scientific staff of the Laser Spectroscopy Research Laboratory (LSRL).&nbsp;Research priorities can vary significantly based on the specific needs and demands of both national and regional contexts.
