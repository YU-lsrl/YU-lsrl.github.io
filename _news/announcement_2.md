<p style="text-align: justify;">The peer review of  our submitted proposal to SESAME in response to it's last call has now been completed and we are glad to inform that our proposal has been awarded 6 operational shifts on the XAFS/XRF beamline. The award of beamtime comes in recognition of the excellence of our proposal and is an in-kind contribution funded through operational budget. The Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East (SESAME) is an independent laboratory located in Allan in the Balqa governorate of Jordan, created under the auspices of UNESCO on 30 May 2002.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">XAFS/XRF is a beamline dedicated to X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. It is built on the bending magnet at the eighth cell of the SESAME storage ring (BM08) and allows access to a wide energy range: from 4.7 to 30 keV, with high photon flux (10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;ph/s) and high beam stability. This meets the needs of a large number of researchers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The XAFS/XRF beamline is designed for X-ray spectroscopic studies in all fields of science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monochromatic X-ray beam of XAFS/XRF, combined with the highly-sensitive 64 element silicon drift detector, and the ionization chambers and motorized stages for sample and detector movements offers the synergistic application of X-Ray Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy for multidisciplinary applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This instrument, which has been hosting users since July 2018, may be used in numerous fields of research among which: environmental science, energy storage, cultural heritage, and catalysis, as well as solid state physics and bio-chemistry.&nbsp;</p>
